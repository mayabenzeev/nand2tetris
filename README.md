## General info
This code pertains to the Nand-to-Tetris course. I have completed projects 1 through 10 of course, encompassing the construction of a computer from basic Nand gates up to the development of functionalities for the Hack computer. This includes both the hardware assembly and the initial stages of software creation.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java version: 11.0.18
* Python version: 3.8.19
	
## Setup
To run projects 1-5, use the Nand2Tetris IDE online (features a Hardware Simulator, a CPU
emulator, and a Hack Assembler) 
https://netalondon.github.io/web-ide/chip
To run projects 6-10, use the following code snippts with the online tests:

6
```
$ cd ~/path_to_project/project6
$ make
$ ./Assembler ~/path_to_test
```
7
```
$ cd ~/path_to_project/project7
$ make
$ ./VMtranslator ~/path_to_test
```
8
```
$ cd ~/path_to_project/project8
$ make
$ ./VMtranslator ~/path_to_test
```
9-10
```
$ cd ~/path_to_project/project10
$ make
$ ./JackAnalyzer ~/path_to_test
```
